# Note: Docker cannot fetch files outside the build context
# Therefore, we build this image from the project's root directory

# Define the base image
FROM node:current-alpine

# Define the working directory
WORKDIR /svelte

# Copy source files (except those in .dockerignore)
COPY node/package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application files (except those listed in .dockerignore)
COPY node/ .

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "run", "prod"]
